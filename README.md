# rock-paper-scissors

This project was inspired through the concept of Rock, Paper, Scissors, and I have decided to implement a main game to interact in the tutorial. In addition, the inspiration has also come from a video by ASMR Sandbox, and the link for the video is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBdw7hHdwhY
## Overview
After watching the video, I have also decided to include additional features such as scores and stats. This has been done through the use of Tkinter, which has generated an idea for me to create a GUI based on the code. Afterwards, I included the additional options; reset, which will enable the user to reset everything from the previous attempts, stats, which will display the wins, losses and ties the user had against the computer.

## Technologies Used

Language: Python
